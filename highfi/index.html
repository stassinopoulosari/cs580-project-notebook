            <h2>Prototype Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                We chose to use the web-based too Figma to design and create an
                interactive high-fidelity prototype for our app. You may click
                the button below to open our high-fidelity prototype to explore
                on your own.
            </p>

                    document.write(
                        "<p><b>Please note that this prototype was created in November 2024 and may not still be online due to Figma licensing costs.</b></p>",

            <h2>User Manual</h2>
            <!-- The document is clear, task-focused, presenting instructions as
            step-by-step procedures and all images, symbols, icons, codes or
            relevant jargon are clearly defined or labeled. The organization is
            logical, e.g., including a table of contents, such that instructions
            are easy to locate. Tasks are grouped chronologically, by frequency
            of use, or by functional category, as appropriate to the nature of
            the document. -->
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <h3>User Population</h3>
            <p>
                We conducted our tests in class on Tuesday, November 12, 2024.
                Our test population was our classmates, who do fit some of the
                user personas we envisioned when conceiving the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because our classmates fit the profile of students and of
                working professionals, they are closest to our
                <a href="..#anchor-persona1">Persona 1</a> and
                <a href="..#anchor-persona2">Persona 2</a> from our proposal.
            </p>
            <h3>Usability Goals</h3>
            <!-- each usability goal is linked to a quantitative/qualitative measurement (where appropriate) -->
            <h3>Usability Test Procedures &amp; Evaluation</h3>
            <h4>Phase 1</h4>
            <p>
                One or two evaluators observe test users interacting with the
                application. Evaluators take notes and observe issues with key
                usability features.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Does the design keep the user informed about what they are
                    doing, progress and status?
                </li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Does the user navigate without difficulty?</li>
                    <li>
                        Are there areas where additional direction or guidance
                        is needed?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Is the terminology familiar and easily understood? Is the
                    terminology consistent throughout the user experience?
                </li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        There are common, non-novel terms. Does the user
                        struggle to understand key words and phrases?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Is the user able to address all preferences when setting up

                    <li>
                        Do we observe the user getting tripped up or lost while
                        setting up a commute?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>

                    <li>
                        Does the user run into difficulties when setting up a
                        commute?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li>
                    Is extra help and documentation required? Is the application

                    <li>
                        Could we have a quick welcome screen for first time user

            <h4>Phase 2</h4>
            <!-- This criterion is linked to a Learning OutcomeUsability Evaluation
            A detailed usability evaluation plan should enable independent evaluators to assess the design with respect to the stated goals for the project -->
            <p>
                In addition to soliciting verbal evaluation from our test
                subjects, we also asked them to fill out a feedback form, of
                which we have embedded a sample below:

            <h3>Results &amp; Analysis</h3>
            <!-- Results and Analysis What did you observe during the tests? What
            comments did users provide? Did any of the tests fail? If so, why?
            This includes discussion of system usability on benchmark tasks as
            assessed through quantitative measurements or heuristics 20 to >12.0
            pts Above and beyond Quantitative summaries completion results for
            measures and qualitative observations (as appropriate) are present
            for all benchmark tasks. User quotes and appropriate images are used
            to illustrate ideas. Similarities and differences across observed
            users are analyzed. A prioritized and clearly well-defined list of
            usability issues (rated high/medium/ low) is provided and the
            analysis is fully justified by the observations. -->
