            <h2>Prototype Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                We chose to use the web-based too Figma to design and create an
                interactive high-fidelity prototype for our app. You may click
                the button below to open our high-fidelity prototype to explore
                on your own.

                    From the user’s phone home screen, the application can be
                    launched with the application button (<i>a</i>).
                    Alternatively, the user may utilize the “get moving” button
                    from the home screen widget (<i>b</i>) to quickly launch the
                    application.
                </p>
                <div class="exhibits">
                    <div class="exhibit">
                        <h4>Item <i>a</i>: Application Button</h4>
                        <img
                            src="../images/user-manual-a.jpg"
                            alt="Application Icon"
                        />
                    </div>
                    <div class="exhibit">
                        <h4>Item <i>b</i>: Home Screen Widget</h4>
                        <img
                            src="../images/user-manual-b.jpg"
                            alt="Home Screen Widget"
                        />
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once the application has been launched, the user is
                    introduced to the home screen of the application. From
                    there, the user can initiate a new commute or review earned
                    rewards. If the user uses the alternative widget launch, the
                    welcome screen is bypassed and the user is moved to the
                    departure selection screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the application has been launched and the user has
                    commenced a commute from either the main screen of the
                    application or by way of the widget “get moving” button, the
                    user is then able to select a location for departure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The default departure location is the user’s current
                    location as determined by map software integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One alternative is to select a designated “home” location
                    which the user can set up in the options menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another alternative is to select another location using the
                    map. Within this option, the user can also select and
                    designate favorite departure locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the user has selected a departure location, they are
                    able to select a method of transportation. To complete the
                    commute, the user may need to select multiple methods of
                    transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the user must select their desired location. Similar
                    to departure location, there are multiple options to choose
                    from. This would include home, various favorites or the
                    option to select a location from the map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, the user starts the commute. Once the commute is
                    in progress, the user manually toggles “next checkpoint”
                    once each checkpoint has been completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once all checkpoints have been completed, the user has
                    arrived at their desired destination and receives an award
                    within the application which celebrates their achieved
                    commute.
                </p>
            </details>
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <h3>User Population</h3>
            <p>
                We conducted our tests in class on Tuesday, November 12, 2024.
                Our test population was our classmates, who do fit some of the
                user personas we envisioned when conceiving the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because our classmates fit the profile of students and of
                working professionals, they are closest to our
                <a href="..#anchor-persona1">Persona 1</a> and
                <a href="..#anchor-persona2">Persona 2</a> from our proposal.
            </p>
            <p>
                For our test session, our application was evaluated by five of
                our classmates, who served as our usability experts. The experts
                were presented with the high fidelity prototype and invited to
                explore it and provide feedback. As defined in our initial
                proposal, our experts were able to consider the broad range of
                transportation methods available in the Portland metropolitan
                area. The users had varying degrees of experience with the
                particular methods of interest, including public transportation,
                micro-mobility, walking, biking and other methods considered. We
                ran as many small tests within our application as we were able
                to afford, considering the time allotted and available for our
                experts. Our application does not have several highly distinct
                groups of users and rather focuses on general use for a wide
                variety of overlapping user types. Our users are expected to
                have similar needs with variability across priorities for their
                commute. Our application enables users to then customize the
                application to their needs so that they can find fun and
                rewarding ways to enhance their commute and hopefully consider
                highly sustainable methods of transport.
            </p>
            <h3>Usability Goals</h3>
            <p>
                The usability goals for the overall project were broadly defined
                in the second deliverable. For the purposes of testing the high
                fidelity prototype with our expert users, we focused
                specifically on these key goals and benchmarks.
            </p>
            <p>These are the usability goals that were tested:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Launching a Trip</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Widget activation</li>
                    <li>Trip initialization from home application screen</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Selecting departure and destination points.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Departure point selection</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Default and alternative options</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Destination point selection</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Default and alternative options</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>Trip type & method selection</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting the desired method of transportation</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Canceling a trip</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to cancel trip</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Progressing trip to conclusion</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to mark of checkpoints</li>
                    <li>Reward upon completion of all checkpoints</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Usability Evaluation (Plan &amp; Results)</h3>
            <p>
                We took notes and made observations in line with our usability
                evaluation plan. We also provided users with a survey to
                complete. We limited the length of the survey to minimize survey
                fatigue and facilitate thoughtful responses.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Does the design keep the user informed about what they are
                    doing, progress and status?
                </li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Does the user navigate without difficulty?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Yes, the users were able to navigate through the
                            application without difficulty. The users benefited
                            from the design which made navigation obvious and
                            clear to the users.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        Are there areas where additional direction or guidance
                        is needed?
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There were some areas for improvement however most
                            issues were related to features that are not yet
                            available or functional. The users had to be advised
                            that some features were not yet functional.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <li>
                    Is the terminology familiar and easily understood? Is the
                    terminology consistent throughout the user experience?
                </li>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        The users were able to easily understand the user
                        interface and navigate with limited prompting. The
                        design was successful in creating an intuitive
                        experience for the user which made the learning curve
                        for usage very minimal. We aim to further improve this
                        with guided walkthroughs and potentially tooltips.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <li>
                    Is the user able to address all preferences when setting up

                        <li>
                            All users were able to successfully conclude their
                            trip through checkpoints and claim their reward.

                            more interactivity was desired. Some users expressed
                            concern over features that were not yet functional
                            within the prototype.

            <p>
                Users felt the rewards system was a compelling and persuasive
                aspect of the application. This was ranked as the most
                encouraging aspect of the application with all survey
                participants considering this one of their top 3 elements. The
                second and third most valued elements were ease of use and
                improving commute time.
