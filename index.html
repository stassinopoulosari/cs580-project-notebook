            <h1>Proposal</h1>
            <h2>Short Summary</h2>
            <p>
                We will create a prototype for a mobile application and widget
                that provides information about travel options that are proximal
                to the user. Our most immediate goal is to have this work within
                the Portland metro area. This will better enable users to
                leverage sustainable transportation options.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe we can impact this goal with our project by
                increasing productivity and encouraging greater use of
                sustainable transportation options. This can be achieved by
                increasing the efficiency of existing technologies and
                transportation options. Users can be better enabled to utilize
                efficient transportation and feel empowered to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideal concept would be a widget that quickly connects a user to
                their destination in the quickest, least expensive and most
                environmentally sustainable manner. This could be connecting a
                series of transportation types and options which could chain
                together to maximize efficiency and minimize impact.
            </p>

            <h2>Observing Users</h2>
            <p>
                At various times, multiple people were observed using TriMet
                MAX. They generally used the mobile wallet tap-to-pay
                functionality to board and experienced long wait times between
                trains. Passengers carried a variety of items, including
                backpacks, purses, personal transportation devices, and even
                overnight luggage. Many individuals brought bikes, strollers, or
                wheelchairs and other assistive devices, facilitating smooth
                transitions between MAX and bus services. Similarly, TriMet
                buses saw numerous riders managing a range of items akin to
                those seen on MAX.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, bicycles were a common mode of commuting,
                alongside cars, which offered freedom and flexibility but could
                be costly and inefficient unless carpooling. Ride-sharing
                services like Uber and Lyft also appeared as commuting options,
                though they shared similar drawbacks in terms of expense and
                efficiency without carpooling.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also observed alternative forms of transportation,
                highlighting a strong association with safety and weather
                considerations. This included manual and e-bikes, manual and
                e-scooters, and various one-wheeled electric devices—but it also
                included heavier forms like motorcycles and mopeds.
            </p>
            <h2>Identifying the Problem</h2>
            <p>
                In order for people to feel empowered to leverage sustainable
                transportation options, it must be efficient and effective.
                Unfortunately, some of the more sustainable transportation
                options are not efficient. This disproportionately impacts the
                poor who are most likely to be negatively impacted by delays
                related to public transportation. They are also least likely to
                be able to afford the most advanced sustainable transportation
                options. The current state is a frustrating maze of varying
                applications and pay mechanisms. Some transportation options may
                also not be immediately obvious or available to all individuals.
            </p>

            <h2>Finding Related Products</h2>
            <p>
                The main two related products we explored were the Transit app
                and Google Maps.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Transit app provides live transit data and encourages its
                users to provide information about their bus or train ride by
                “gamifying” the experience and awarding cooperative users with
                points that can place them on a monthly leaderboard. It also
                provides bicycling data, but it will only suggest bicycling if
                no transit routes are available and does not take weather into
                account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Google Maps prioritizes driving over all other methods of
                transportation. Its bicycling data also does not take weather
                into account and its transit data is not as user-friendly as the
                Transit app. Live bus locations and headways are hidden in a
                submenu in both the app and website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both of these products also default to requiring a route be
                actively input by the user, rather than using their commute at
                all times. Apple Maps, for instance, suggests commuting options
                over entering a route when location data indicates you are at
                home or at work. It suffers from the same limitations as Google
                Maps, however.
            </p>
            <h2>Comparing Products</h2>
            <p>
                Our solution will encourage users to use active or public
                transportation over private cars and ride-sharing. It will
                combine the useful bicycle data of the Transit app with weather
                data to suggest taking public transportation on a rainy day or
                biking on a sunny day. It will also be a specifically
                commute-focused app which always has directions and the most
                optimal commuting option available.
            </p>

                The system will consist of a mobile app and a home screen widget
                for mobile devices. The mobile app will be used to configure a
                user’s commute, while the best commuting option will remain
                displayed to the user in the widget.
            </p>
            <h2>Justifying Feasibility</h2>
            <p>
                Weeks 1–2: We will begin by establishing the key features of our
                project and drafting the initial design for the website and its
                connected features.
            </p>
            <p>
                Weeks 3–6: This phase will involve constructing and coding the
                project, applying an iterative process to develop the basic
                functions, architecture, and artifacts. This will likely be the
                most intensive part of our sprint, requiring close collaboration
                to refine key concepts and assess what features can
                realistically be achieved within the semester. During this time,
                we will also assemble surveys and start aggregating responses.
                We may utilize Python and the OpenAI API to generate concise
                directions for navigation, as outlined in our ideas addendum.
                Ari, with experience in iOS and Android app development as well
                as website creation using GitHub Pages, will lead development
                efforts, while Travis will focus on enhancing his core
                programming skills. He brings experience in R, Python, and SQL,
                which will allow him to contribute to coding tasks and assist in
                generating visuals using AI-assisted image tools. Additionally,
                we plan to leverage ChatGPT for coding assistance to accelerate
                our progress and simplify the learning of essential components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Weeks 7–8: In this stage, we will test and iterate on our
                initial versions, ensuring that they closely resemble the final
                presentation. We will confirm the structure for our class
                demonstration and identify any viable features to add, while
                removing unnecessary ones. We will also create and organize
                survey feedback, evaluating and analyzing the responses to
                inform our updates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Weeks 9–10: The final weeks will be dedicated to finalizing key
                components of the project in preparation for our presentation.
                We will incorporate and address the feedback received throughout
                the process and outline future revisions and next steps,
                establishing a vision for the project's future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout all phases of the project, we will document our code,
                ensure that we continuously iterate to ensure our product and
                strategy are in line with the wants and needs of our users, and
                we will remain open to removing or reforming features which may
                not work for the small scale of this course.
